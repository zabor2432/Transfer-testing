prototype assets to know better dagster workflow, we should restructure it later.
running this: 
go into project root directory and type:
`dagster dev -f transfer-testing/assets/etl.py`

go to localhost:3000

select all assets with SHIFT and click materialize

It's a code that does nothing, it's just here to quickly run and test if dagster is working
